/***
 * Portfolio System Plans
 * 
 * Our goal is that each student gets associated with a google drive folder owned by this account.
 * This account would then also *share* that folder with kids.
 * 
 * We then need the capacity to...
 * -> Generate new folders as students are enrolled
 * -> Share those folders with staff and students
 * 
 * 
 * For our "first" time running, we also want the capability to...
 * -> Check the link to the current Google Site in Aspen
 *     --> If it exists, create a google doc with the link
 *         => If the link works, include the link in the doc.
 *         => If the link *doesn't* work, put a note to the student that it needs fixing.
 * 
 * For long-term, we will want the ability to...
 * -> Create advisor folders full of short-cuts to portfolios of all advisees.
 * -> Create grade level folders with short-cuts to portfolios of all students
 * -> Create template system where we can...
 *    => Copy file into folders -> this just means listing folder IDs (which we know) and listing file(s) to copy
 * 
 *
