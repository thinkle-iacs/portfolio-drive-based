 * Note that this file is NOT container attached but run from a single script.
 * If we want to make container-attached scripts as an easy tool, we will need to
 * hard-code the location of our PORTFOLIO_HOME and PORTFOLIO_SHEET
 * 
 * This code will output the IDs of those files to the spreadsheet that controls it.
 * Any container-attached code that we copy will then need to have those items set
 * by hand!
